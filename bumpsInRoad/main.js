// Your car is old, it breaks easily. The shock absorbers are gone and you think it can handle about 15 more bumps before it dies totally.

// Unfortunately for you, your drive is very bumpy! Given a string showing either flat road ("_") or bumps ("n"), work out if you make it home safely. 15 bumps or under, return "Woohoo!", over 15 bumps return "Car Dead".
